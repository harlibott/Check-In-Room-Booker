## Introduction
Over my web programming course at UGA, me and my team's final project was to create a full stack web application of our choosing. We decided to create a study room booker. 

## The Problem
At UGA, there is always a shortage of study rooms. You end up wasting a lot of time walking through every building trying to find an open room. Our vision was to create a web application that will serve as a self check in / checkout using your student id to login. The rooms were broken down by building, floor, and room number. Once you select the approriate field, a map of the rooms appear. Green is availible, red is unavailible. The student will be able to "check in" to the room to notify other students that that room is occupied. A student will not be able to check in to another room unless they check out of the current one.
